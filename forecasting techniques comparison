Comparison of Forecasting Techniques – Stationary vs Non-Stationary Methods (With DAX Examples)

1. Introduction
   Forecasting requires understanding whether a dataset is stationary (constant mean/variance) or non-stationary (trends or seasonality present). In this project, we use the DAX index from EuStockMarkets as a real-world example of a financial time series.

2. Stationarity Assessment

* Plotting the DAX series revealed a clear upward trend.
* Applying 5-day and 20-day moving averages smoothed short-term fluctuations but confirmed the overall trend.
* Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test can formally check stationarity:

```r
library(tseries)
adf.test(dax_ts)
```

* Example result: p-value > 0.05 → non-stationary (trend present).
* Therefore, the DAX series is mostly non-stationary, requiring differencing (for ARIMA) or a non-stationary method like ETS.

3. Stationary Methods Example

* ARIMA: Using auto.arima() on differenced DAX series:

```r
library(forecast)
fit_arima <- auto.arima(dax_ts)
forecast_10 <- forecast(fit_arima, h = 10)
plot(forecast_10)
```

* Observations: Captures short-term fluctuations; forecast intervals widen with time.
* SMA (5-day/20-day): Useful for trend visualization but cannot forecast future values reliably.

4. Non-Stationary Methods Example

* ETS (Exponential Smoothing):

```r
fit_ets <- ets(dax_ts)
forecast_ets <- forecast(fit_ets, h = 10)
plot(forecast_ets)
```

* Observations: Captures the upward trend smoothly; short-term forecasts follow trend better than ARIMA on non-differenced data.

* STL Decomposition + Forecasting:

```r
dax_ts_weekly <- ts(dax_ts, frequency = 5)
fit_stl <- stlf(dax_ts_weekly, h = 10)
plot(fit_stl)
```

* Observations: Separates trend and residual fluctuations; forecast follows trend while accounting for short-term irregularities.

5. Key Comparisons (with DAX Examples)
   | Feature | ARIMA | ETS | SMA | STL Forecast |
   |---------|-------|-----|-----|--------------|
   | Stationarity Requirement | Yes (differencing required) | No | Yes | No |
   | Handles Seasonality | SARIMA only | Yes (trend + seasonality) | No | Yes |
   | Trend Capture | Differencing | Explicit trend | No | Trend component |
   | Forecast Horizon | Short-term | Short-term | Visualization only | Short-term |
   | Confidence Intervals | Wider with more steps | Smoother, narrower | N/A | Moderate |
   | DAX Example | Captured short-term fluctuations | Followed trend smoothly | Visualized trends | Separated trend and residuals |

6. Summary / Interpretation

* DAX is non-stationary, showing an upward trend.
* SMA is useful for visualizing trends but cannot forecast.
* ARIMA works after differencing; captures short-term fluctuations but may produce wide confidence intervals.
* ETS and STL handle non-stationary trends naturally, providing smoother forecasts.
* Practical takeaway: For financial indices with trends, ETS or STL is generally preferable; ARIMA is better if the series can be made stationary.

7. Recommendation

* Plot the series and assess stationarity.
* Use SMA for smoothing, ARIMA for stationary modeling, and ETS/STL for non-stationary forecasting.
* Evaluate forecast accuracy using RMSE, MAE, or MAPE.
